# Morse_Code

Just a simple program that takes an input, converts it to morse code, outputs the encoded and decoded versions, and plays the corresponding sound.

In the Python folder are two programs. One I used to generate the dot and dash sounds, the other one can be used to take an input, convert it to morse, and play the corresponding sound.

Todo:
- Add a "play sound" feature to the Morse Code github.io page
- Style the page with css
- Add link here
